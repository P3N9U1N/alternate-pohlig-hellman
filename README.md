# An algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm

This repository contains an algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm. It is efficient if the multiplicative order is a smooth number,
making it an alternative to the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm.


## Requirements
Following packages are needed:
```
